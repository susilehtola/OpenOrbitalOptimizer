OpenOrbitalOptimizer: a reusable orbital optimization library

This is a general library aimed for orbital optimization problems that
arise with various methods in quantum chemistry, ranging from
self-consistent field (SCF) methods like Hartree-Fock (HF) and density
functional theory (DFT) to more elaborate methods like
multiconfigurational self-consistent field theory, orbital-optimized
coupled-cluster theory, generalized valence bond theories, etc.

At the moment, the library only does Roothaan-type SCF for HF and DFT
calculations, but general algorithms for direct minimization on the
Grassmann and Stiefel manifolds are forthcoming.

The library is open source, licensed under the permissive Mozilla
Public License 2.0.
